                  <p itemprop="description"><em>The arrangement of the chemical elements into periods (horizontal rows) and groups (vertical columns) is called the periodic table.</em></p>
                  <h2>What is its usage?</h2>
                  <p itemprop="description">The periodic table is an essential part of the language of chemistry. It has much in common with a thesaurus, providing a guide to similarities and differences among the elements. From the way elements are organized in the periodic table, chemists can predict their behavior and write chemical formulas of compounds using just a few general guidelines.</p>

                  <div class="gallery_box"> 
                    <p>1669 - Hennig Brand invented the Philosopher's Stone, which could turn metals into pure gold. He also discovered phosphorus.</p>
                    <p>1680 - Robert Boyle also discovered phosphorus without knowing about Hennig Brand's discovery.</p>
                    <p>By 1809 about 47 elements had been discovered and named. Scientists began to see patterns in their atom structures.</p>
                    <p>1863 - John Newlands organized the 56 then known elements into eleven separate groups based upon their atom structure.</p>
                    <p>1869 - Dimitri Mendellev used John Newlands' grouping and organized the elements into what is now known as the periodic table. He used the atomic mass as the primary characteristic to decide where each element belonged in his table.  The elements were arranged in rows and columns. He even left spaces for elements to be discovered because of the pattern he saw once he started organizing those elements known at that that time. </p>
                    <p>1886 - Antoine Becquerel discovered radioactivity.Ernest Rutherford named three types of radiation: alpha and betaand gamma rays.Pierre and Marie Curie began their work and discovered radium and polonium. They also discovered that beta particles were negatively charged.</p>
                    <p>1894 - Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh discovered the noble gasesand they were added to the periodic table as group O.</p>
                    <p>1897 - J. J. Thomson discovered electrons which were small negatively charged particles.John Sealy Townsend and Robert A. Millikan further investigated electrons and were able to determine their exact charge and mass.</p>
                    <p>1900 - Antoine Becquerel discovered that electrons and beta particles were the same thing.</p>
                    <p>1903 - Ernest Rutherford decided that radioactivity is what caused atoms to be broken down.</p>
                    <p>1911 - Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger discovered that electrons moved around the nucleus of the cell's atom much like planets orbit the sun.</p>
                    <p>1913 - Niels Bohr discovered the electrons' orbits and that there were more electrons in the outer orbits than in the inner orbits. He also saw that radiation was emitted when an electron would jump from one orbit to another.</p>
                    <p>1914 - Ernest Rutherford discovered protons in the nucleus.Henry Moseley labeled the elements with atomic numbers based upon the number of electrons in an atom rather than on their atomic mass.</p>
                    <p>1932 - James Chadwick discovered neutrons and identified isotopes.J. D. Cockroft and Ernest T. S. Walton worked together in splitting the atom when working with lithium which they bombarded with protons. The lithium nucleus was divided into two helium nuclei.Ernest O. Lawrence, Milton Stanley Livingston and Milton White worked on the first cyclotron at the University of California in Berkeley. </p>
                    <p>1945 - Glenn Seaborg identified lanthanides and actinides which are elements with atomic numbers higher than 92 and are placed in a separate section on the bottom in today's Periodic Table.</p>

In other words, hydrogen doesn't easily fit into any chemical family.And each of the elements in IIA family will lose two valence electrons and form +2 ions in order to have an electron configuration like the closest noble gas.Other metal elements' charges can be predicted using the same patterns.</p>
			      <p>Family VA nonmetals at the top will gain electrons to form negative ions. Family VIA nonmetals will gain two electrons to obtain an octet thus forming a -2 ion. Family VIIA will form -1 ions.Family VIIIA is the noble gases and has no tendency to either gain or lose electrons so they do not form ions.The charges ions form can be shown in the following table.

                <h1>The ordering of elements</h1>
                <p>The periodic table is an arrangement of the elements in order of their atomic numbers so that elements with similar properties appear in the same vertical column or group.A period is a horizontal row of the periodic table. There are seven periods in the periodic table, with each one beginning at the far left. A new period begins when a new principal energy level begins filling with electrons. They are pulled out in order to make the table itself fit more easily onto a single page.A group is a vertical column of the periodic table, based on the organization of the outer shell electrons. There are a total of 18 groups.The official system for numbering groups would be a simple 1 through 18 from left to right. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of that element. An atom can be classified as a particular element based solely on its atomic number. The periodic table displays all of the known elements and is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. In the periodic table,an element's atomic number is indicated above the elemental symbol. </p>

                  <div class="gallery_box">
                    <p itemprop="description">Metallic character refers to the level of reactivity of a metal. Metals tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, as indicated by their low ionization energies. Within a compound, metal atoms have relatively low attraction for electrons, as indicated by their low electronegativities.The most reactive metals would reside in the lower left portion of the periodic table. The most reactive metal is cesium.Francium is below cesium in the alkali metal group, but is so rare that most of its properties have never been observed.</p>
			        <p itemprop="description">Reactivity of metals is based on processes such as the formation of halide compounds with halogens and how easily they displace hydrogen from dilute acids.The metallic character increases as you go down a group. Since the ionization energy decreases going down a group (or increases going up a group), the increased ability for metals lower in a group to lose electrons makes them more reactive. In addition, the atomic radius increases going down a group, placing the outer electrons further away from the nucleus and making that electron less attracted by the nucleus.</p>
			        <p itemprop="image"><img src="images/metallic character.png" alt="metallic characters"></p>
			        <p itemprop="description">As we move across the periodic table, there is an increasing tendency to accept electrons (nonmetallic) and a decrease in the possibility that an atom would give up one or more electrons.</p>
